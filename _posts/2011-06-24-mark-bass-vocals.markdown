<h1>Mark Wolf</h1>
<strong></strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-305" title="mark-scaled" src="http://artiosband.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mark-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="97" height="159" />Mark hails from the sunny shores of England. He’s been playing since he was eleven and spent most of his time in the jazz idiom. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in music and chemistry in 2008 and has been expanding his music horizons since then. In his spare time he likes to snowboard, play soccer and take long walks on the beach. When he says long, he means long. None of those one or two hour walks. He plans to continue playing bass long into the years of senility.
