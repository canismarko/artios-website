Hey Artios fans! We have been hard at work the past couple months and
its about time for an update as to the progress we have been
making. Where to start?

We finished up all of my lead vocal parts for the first 7 songs on the
album. Most of the harmony parts have also been completed for the
first 7 songs. While working on doing harmony parts for "Barn 01" we
brought in our good friend Hal to help fill out our group singing
section.
