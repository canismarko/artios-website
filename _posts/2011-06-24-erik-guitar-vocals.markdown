<h1>Erik Sebastian</h1>
<a href="http://artiosband.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/eman-scaled.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-303" title="Erik" src="http://artiosband.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/eman-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="88" height="186" /></a>Erik is a homegrown hero born and raised in Vicksburg, MI. He has been playing guitar for the past thirteen years in addition to a variety of other instruments. His biggest influences have been Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughn, the Beatles and many more while he searched for his own musical style. When he’s not shredding he enjoys winter snow sports, working on cars and performing the hokey pokey. Throughout his life Erik strives to return mainstream music to its former glory.
