So the last few days I've been struggling to get heat going on my RepRap. I tracked the problem to the resistor that generates the heat itself. It's effectively a piece of coiled wire made of an appropriate material. It's supposed to have an internal resistance of 6.8Ω. This is very low as far as resistors go and is what allows it to get hot. Using a multi-meter, I measure the resistance across mine at 5-10 MΩ. That's approximately one million times higher than it should be. My guess is that the coiled wire has broken somewhere along the line and is no longer passing current.

I got in touch with the nice people at <a title="Lulzbot" href="http://www.lulzbot.com/en/">lulzbot</a> and Steven is sending me a replacement resistor that should arrive soon. It's always frustrating to have defective merchandise but I was very pleased with how responsive and helpful Lulzbot has been. Once it arrives, it should be fairly straightforward to swap out and I can then see if I'm getting heat as expected. This will also give me a chance to clean up the wiring, now that I know how long everything needs to be.
