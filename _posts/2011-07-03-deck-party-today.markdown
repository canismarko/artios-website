      We played at Erik and Patrick's parents' party today. The
      weather was great and the company was even better. Mike had to
      work in the middle of the afternoon so we played early. Sure
      some people might not consider 1PM to be early but for musicians
      getting up before the sun goes down is outside of our comfort
      zone. We had some great times with friends. We also got to share
      our music with the people that floated by on pontoon boats
      during the course of our show. If you were on one of those
      boats, I hope you had a great time out on the lake today.

      The day was not without its problems, though. Pat broke a string
      on the acoustic guitar. Our friend Joe offered up his guitar
      but the lack of a pickup meant we couldn't use it. All things
      considered, though, the show was a success. A special thanks to
      the Sebastians for hosting us and to everyone that came and
      enjoyed our music. I had to leave at five but I hear there were
      some jam sessions that happened after that, too.
