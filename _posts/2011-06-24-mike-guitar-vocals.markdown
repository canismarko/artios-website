<h1>Mike Grammes</h1>
<strong></strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-308" title="Mike Grammes" src="http://artiosband.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mike-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="97" height="159" />Mike has been involved with music most of his life. He has received a Bachelor of Arts in Music with a creative writing minor from Western Michigan University. Mike was born and raised in various places in Michigan until he finally settled in Kalamazoo and joined Artios. His musical power is contained in his “chops” and he will never let a Delilah cut them off. His musical influences are anything that he deems “good music” which mostly means jazz, blues, and anything that rocks. For Mike music is the soul’s communication with the world.
