      Sorry there hasn't been a post in a while. Â I'd come up with
      some great excuse but I don't really have one. I bought an
      acoustic guitar over the weekend so I suppose I could use the
      excuse that I've been playing that. We've actually been quite
      busy lately. We got Pat's acoustic guitar track recorded
      for <em>Down in Flames</em>. We're also half way through Erik's
      vocal harmony part for <em>These Four Walls</em>. Unfortunately
      he's got a cold or something similar. Playing an instrument with
      a cold is annoying but the instrument's not affected. Singing
      with a cold is a whole other story and he's been fighting to get
      a good tone. We got a good chuck of it done, though. Pat also
      came up with a additional harmony for the bridge of <em>These
      Four Walls</em> that sounds killer.

      Mike got his hair cut last week. If you don't know Mike it
      probably sounds like we need to get some better material to
      write about. If you do know Mike you're probably struggling to
      comprehend what you just read. He's had long hair for a while
      now and last week he got most of it chopped off and donated it
      to <a href="http://www.locksoflove.org/">Locks of Love</a>. They
      will take the hair and use it to make wigs for children
      suffering hair loss due to medical conditions. I'm not sure if
      he plans to grow it out again or not but it was quite a shock
      when he walked into the studio.
