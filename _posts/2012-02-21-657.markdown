Some parts arrived today. These are the parts that were made on another RepRap machine. All together they cost me $75 on eBay. It's hard to tell from the photo but they're a wonderful shade of neon green. I'm not sure if I like the color yet or not; I'll have to see what it looks like all together. Somehow I put in the wrong shipping info when I bought these things and it went to an old address. Not my last address but the one before that. I tried all kinds of things to get it sent somewhere helpful but nothing seemed to work. Finally I just drove past the house and it was sitting on the front porch so I nabbed it. I'm surprised that we don't have a huge problem with miscreants taking packages like that. Oh well.

I also got the smooth rod from <a title="onlinemetals.com" href="http://www.onlinemetals.com" target="_blank">onlinemetals.com</a>. I was pretty impressed. I have yet to see what the quality of it is but I'll post it here. The one thing that concerns me a little about the smooth is that my directions are in metric and onlinemetals.com only has SAE sizes with metric approximations. I hope it's the right size.
