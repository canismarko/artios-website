title: Finished piano for Barn 01

Well we finished all of Pat's piano parts for <em>Barn 01</em>
tonight. He had two parts we tracked. There's a deep heavy part
underneath the light poppy part you may recognize from our live
shows. Being able to record multiple passes gives us so many more
options for part-writing. Who knows, we may even add an organ part.

I also got a chance to play around with MIDI. This method records the
keys Pat presses as individual events rather than capturing the audio
produced by the keyboard (we did record that too). This will let us
take his part and add or change the sound made by his keyboard during
mix-time. It might save us the trouble of re-recording the part if
there turns out to be something we wanted differently.

Below is what the part looks like. The red section shows the part
Patrick was actively recording at the time. The grey section
underneath that is capturing which keys he's pressing (MIDI). If you
want to hear it instead of just seeing it, make sure to watch for the
release of this song down the line.
