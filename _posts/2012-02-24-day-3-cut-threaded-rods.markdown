These rods will be the frame for the RepRap. They get combined with various plastic parts and hardware to make a (hopefully) sturdy structure for the rest of the device. I cut these down in Vicksburg at <a title="Ryan (Drums, Vocals)" href="http://artiosband.com/new-about-us/meet-the-band/ryan-drums-vocals/">Ryan</a>'s dad's workshop. It was much easier to cut that the smooth rods. The smooth rods are 304 stainless steel and these are a standard steel with zinc coating. They do have a nice finish to them, still.
