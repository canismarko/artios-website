<h1><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;">In case you weren't near a radio two weeks ago we now have a recording of our performance on The Basement Show on WIDR (89.1FM). Special thanks to Bryan Heany for hosting us and the two assistants who were there helping out. We had a great time and look forward to playing again someday.</span></h1>
