I got the rods cut today. It took a hacksaw and a hell of a lot of work. If I ever decide to build another one I'm definitely going to cut them with some sort of electric saw.Â These will form the guides, two for each axis. It's very important that they be as straight as possible. These seem to be in very good shape so that's good news.
