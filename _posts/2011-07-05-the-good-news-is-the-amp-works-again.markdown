      …the bad news is we didn’t have any time left to record
      anything. We started out by getting Mike’s amp up in the attic
      of the barn. This wasn’t easy to begin with; in case you hadn’t
      noticed (or don’t live in Michigan) it was very hot today. So we
      got Mike’s amp up and running and were about to track when we
      noticed an obnoxious buzz in the microphones. We switched it out
      with Erik’s amp and realized that had a buzz in it, too.

      As we looked in we noticed that one of the transformers had come
      off and was stuck to the magnetic speaker. I think everyone’s
      response was the same: “Huh…” We figured we could tackle this
      problem easily, though. We pulled apart the amp. That was an
      adventure in itself. There’s always one screw you can’t find
      that’s keeping the whole thing from coming out. Then we had to
      remove the main circuit board so we could get underneath it to
      the screw. A few zip-ties later and we had the transformer
      properly (and I use the term loosely) seated back in its
      spot. Then we soldered the inputs back in to place. With
      constant, fermented abuse they had become loose.

 Of course, no band repair job is complete without tape; Mike taped
 down the inputs to the board so they will hopefully last longer this
 time. After that we just had to put everything back together. Turns
 out we weren’t done, though. Two out of the four screws that hold the
 speaker in place had fallen out. The other two were about ready to
 fall out. We’re still not quite sure what was holding it in place.
