As we looked in we noticed that one of the transformers had come off and was stuck to the magnetic speaker. I think everyone's response was the same: "Huh..." We figured we could tackle this problem easily, though. We pulled apart the amp. That was an adventure in itself. There's always one screw you can't find that's keeping the whole thing from coming out. Then we had to remove the main circuit board so we could get underneath it to the screw. A few zip-ties later and we had the transformer properly (and I use the term loosely) seated back in its spot. Then we soldered the inputs back in to place. With constant, fermented abuse they had become loose. Of course, no band repair job is complete without tape; Mike taped down the inputs to the board so they will hopefully last longer this time. After that we just had to put everything back together. Turns out we weren't done, though. Two out of the four screws that hold the speaker in place had fallen out. The other two were about ready to fall out. We're still not quite sure what was holding it in place.
