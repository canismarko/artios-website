Well we finished <a title="Patrick (Keys, Vocals )" href="http://www.artiosband.com/?page_id=155">Patrick</a>'s lead vocal part to <em>It's Alright</em> last week. We had a very productive night despite have to delay our start by an hour and half due to the concert going on in the recital hall next door. Normally the rooms are sonically separated enough that the recital hall doesn't bleed into the live sound room. This time, though, we were up against a <a href="http://www.duniyadrumanddance.org/">drum ensemble</a> so we had to wait. Eventually we got underway, though, and captured some great sounding vocals.

Here you can see a clip of what we were up to. The "dancing" presented in this clip does not represent the views of Artios or any of its individual members. For inquires and angry letters, please send them directly to <a title="Patrick (Keys, Vocals )" href="http://www.artiosband.com/?page_id=155">Patrick</a>.
