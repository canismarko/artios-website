Well we finished Patrick's lead vocal part to <em>It's Alright</em>
last week. We had a very productive night despite have to delay our
start by an hour and half due to the concert going on in the recital
hall next door. Normally the rooms are sonically separated enough that
the recital hall doesn't bleed into the live sound room. This time,
though, we were up against a drum ensemble so we had to
wait. Eventually we got underway, though, and captured some great
sounding vocals.

Here you can see a clip of what we were up to. The "dancing" presented
in this clip does not represent the views of Artios or any of its
individual members. For inquires and angry letters, please send them
directly to Patrick.
