<h2>Band Info</h2>
<div>

Artios is an original rock/pop band out of the Midwest. They have been playing shows in the Kalamazoo and other areas for many years. In the summers of 2006 and 2007 they hosted a music festival affectionately known as the Fieldside Music Festival, which was met with much enthusiasm. The founding members <strong>Erik Sebastian</strong> (guitar), <strong>Pat Sebastian</strong> (keys), and <strong>Ryan Cousins</strong>(drums) started the band at the start of the new millennium. Nick Goodman (bass) joined in 2003 and helped to build their reputation until he left at the end of 2006. 2005 saw the addition of <strong>Mike Grammes</strong> (sax, guitar). The final addition of <strong>Mark Wolf</strong> (bass) happened on New Years Day 2007.

Artios’s sound has matured from strong blues roots into a more modern rock/pop style that still maintains the spontaneity and soul of blues with the addition of hard rocking riffs and listener friendly melodies and harmonies. Each member of Artios has strong musical backgrounds that range from jazz to rock, from blues to country and even classical, with everything in between. Through the melding of these different styles and the level of each person’s musicianship Artios has developed a style that is distinctly its own.
