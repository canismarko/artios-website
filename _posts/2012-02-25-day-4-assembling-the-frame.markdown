I had a chance to get started on assembling the frame today. This part of the project was basically an erector set for adults. The roller-skate bearings came in and with the threaded rod I cut I was able to get through these first couple of steps. I had to cut two additional sections of threaded rod that I then used to make sure the distances between the plastic pieces were correct. The plastic parts that are between vertices are not in the right place, though, and the threaded rod that goes through the center of the bottom face is also not positioned correctly. These need to be aligned with other components that aren't ready yet so I have to wait on those.
