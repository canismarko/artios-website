<p style="text-align: justify;">So I recently decided to start a new project. It's called <em>RepRap. </em>The problem it solves is all too common to most of us. I need a plastic piece to replace something that's broken. I could 1) order it from the manufacturer for a lot of money or 2) try and find a used part that may or may not be in good shape. Well with the RepRap I can just build my own. It's sometimes called a 3D printer. It allows people to print their own, custom designed plastic parts. It's also open source, which is always a nice plus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I've already ordered the parts. The grand total came in right around $750. I got lazy on a few of the pieces and ordered the assembled version. The way I see it, I don't want to be messing around with assembling the hot-end and soldering my own electronics; I'll have enough to worry about without that. I got the parts in the mail today that were printed on another reprap. I bought them online for $75 (plus shipping). In case you're curious about what I ordered or where I ordered it from. Here's myÂ <a href="http://www.artiosband.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/parts-list.ods">parts-list</a>. Well nothing to do now but wait for the FedEx guy. Until next time.</p>
