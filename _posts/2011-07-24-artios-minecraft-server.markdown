This post isn't music related so sorry about that. If you've not heard of <a title="Minecraft" href="http://www.minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>, it's a cross-platform computer game that's incredibly addicting. It's <a title="Minecraft" href="http://www.minecraft.net" target="_blank">available for download</a> for a small fee (20USD last time I looked). The basic idea involves using the materials available to build an unlimited world of structures and devices.
