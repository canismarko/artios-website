Yesterday we started tracking bass for Break. I finally bought an SVT classic bass amp. We borrowed one last year but kept feeling the pressure since we didn't know when the owner would get a rental and need to take it back. I know own my own and we'll be able to leave it set up as long as possible. So far, it sounds AMAZING! It gives a nice, clean tone with just the right amount of color in the low end. We fiddled around with the settings for a while and now have a tone we're thrilled with. Thursday we'll start tracking.
