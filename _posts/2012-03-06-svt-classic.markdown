Yesterday we started tracking bass for Break. I finally bought an SVT
classic bass amp. We borrowed one last year but kept feeling the
pressure since we didn't know when the owner would get a rental and
need to take it back. I know own my own and we'll be able to leave it
set up as long as possible. So far, it sounds AMAZING! It gives a
nice, clean tone with just the right amount of color in the low
end. We fiddled around with the settings for a while and now have a
tone we're thrilled with. Thursday we'll start tracking.

It's so pretty. Hopefully I can avoid spilling beer on it for at
least a few weeks.
