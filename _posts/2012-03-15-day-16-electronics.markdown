I got a good chuck of work done today getting the electronics wired up. It's quite a daunting task since there's a bag of connectors and then wires that run everywhere to begin with. I had to crimp all the end for the motor leads. I just wound up soldering the leads for the endstops since I couldn't find clips small enough to do it the other way.

The RAMPS component sits on top of an Arduino Mega 2560 board. Pretty much everything plugs into the RAMPS except for the USB cable, which plugs into the Arduino. I have about half of the electronics done so far. Next time I'll finish up the wiring and then make it all look pretty.
