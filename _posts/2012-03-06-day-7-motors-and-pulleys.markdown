Well the project is finally starting to come together. Â Mounting the motors for the Z-axis was a pain. It's helpful to have a little play in their positioning so I made some hard-rubber gromits but had a hard time getting the screws in from the bottom and getting the gromits to line up underneath the motor. Some creative taping, though, and it worked. The motors then turn the threaded rods along the Z-axis which drives the X-axis up and down.

I then snapped some bushings onto the X-axis smooth rods but they were a little hard to move. I took a spare piece of smooth rod, put it into some boiling water, then snapped the bushings onto the hot metal. The plastic melted a little and once they cooled, slid much easier on the axis. After gluing the carriage on and running the belt, the X-axis is done.
