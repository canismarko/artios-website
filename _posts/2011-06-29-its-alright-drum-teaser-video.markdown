Here's a video we took over the winter if I remember right. We posted it on facebook but not on any of the other channels. If you've already seen it, sorry. If not, take a look.

It's a video of Ryan tracking his parts to the song It's Alright. The audio on this video is the actual audio that will appear on the final album. We were at <a title="Monaco Bay" href="http://www.monacobay.biz/">Monaco Bay</a> in Kalamazoo. It's a bar we attend from time to time after our sessions and gigs are done. <a title="Patrick (Keys, Vocals )" href="http://blog.artiosband.com/?page_id=155">Pat</a> had a brief stint there as a keyboard player and <a title="Erik (Guitar, Vocals)" href="http://blog.artiosband.com/?page_id=169">Erik</a> works there as a live sound engineer as well as taking up the drum set from time to time. The room sounded great. Sorry to all the audiophiles out there but I don't remember what we used to mic this thing.
