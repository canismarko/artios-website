Here's a video we took over the winter if I remember right. We posted
it on facebook but not on any of the other channels. If you've already
seen it, sorry. If not, take a look.

It's a video of Ryan tracking his parts to the song <em>It's Alright</em>. The
audio on this video is the actual audio that will appear on the final
album. We were at
<a title="Monaco Bay" href="http://www.monacobay.biz/">Monaco Bay</a>
in Kalamazoo. It's a bar we attend from time to time after our
sessions and gigs are done. Pat had a brief stint there as a keyboard
player and Erik works there as a live sound engineer as well as taking
up the drum set from time to time. The room sounded great. Sorry to
all the audiophiles out there but I don't remember what we used to mic
this thing.
