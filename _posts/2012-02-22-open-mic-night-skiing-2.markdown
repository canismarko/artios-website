<p style="text-align: justify;">We needed a night off from the constant editing and mixing thing so we decided to go out to <a title="Louie's Trophy House" href="http://www.louiestrophyhousegrill.com/default.html">Louie's Trophy House</a> to play a few songs for their open mic night. It was great to play with these guys again. Unfortunately, we didn't have <a title="Ryan (Drums, Vocals)" href="http://www.artiosband.com/?page_id=198">Ryan</a> since he was feeling under the weather; Erik jumped over to the kit and we went with one fewer guitar. We played a few originals and then invited some people up for a "super-jam" (really it was just Artios with Jeff on drums, thanks Jeff) at which point <a title="Mike (Guitar, Sax, Vocals)" href="http://www.artiosband.com/?page_id=189">Mike</a> busted out his EWI which can make some impressive sounds.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Last night was also the last night of our beloved race league for this year. The team is not restricted to Artios members but four out of five are in the band. Ryan has class on Tuesdays so he can't make it. We had free pizza and several pitchers of beer. Good times. Never mind the fact that our team placed dead last; we got first in drinking.</p>
