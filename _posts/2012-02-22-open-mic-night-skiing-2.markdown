      We needed a night off from the constant editing and mixing thing
      so we decided to go out to
      <a title="Louie's Trophy House"
	 href="http://www.louiestrophyhousegrill.com/default.html">
	Louie's Trophy House</a> to play a few songs for their open mic
      night. It was great to play with these guys again. Unfortunately,
      we didn't have Ryan since he was feeling under the weather; Erik
      jumped over to the kit and we went with one fewer guitar. We
      played a few originals and then invited some people up for a
      "super-jam" (really it was just Artios with Jeff on drums, thanks
      Jeff) at which point Mike busted out his EWI which can make some
      impressive sounds.

      Last night was also the last night of our beloved race league
      for this year. The team is not restricted to Artios members but
      four out of five are in the band. Ryan has class on Tuesdays so
      he can't make it. We had free pizza and several pitchers of
      beer. Good times. Never mind the fact that our team placed dead
      last; we got first in drinking.
