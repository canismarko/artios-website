I am having a bit of a problem with the direct out on the back of the head, though. We're working on a recording project and if I turn up the monitors or put on a good pair of headphones and listen to what we're getting to tape, I hear a slightly annoying buzz with a very high noise floor.Â I listened back to some of the tracks we got when I first go the amp and it's there too, although quieter (could be due to different pre-amp settings). We don't get this problem in the mics that are picking the sound coming out of the cab.

Here's what I've done so far:
<ul>
	<li>Ensured the bias on the tubes was set according to the manufacturers instructions.</li>
<ul>
	<li>Turned either bank out of bias did increase the low frequency noise in the cabinet, we set it to the minimum noise floor within the proper biasing conditions.</li>
</ul>
	<li>We got some of the initial noise down by connecting a ground to the outlet we were using.</li>
	<li>We took the amp to the studio at the local University. The noise actually seemed a little worse.</li>
<ul>
	<li>Switched between Jensen and Crane Song pre-amps.</li>
	<li>A/D was ProTools HD</li>
	<li>All equipment in the analog domain was fed from power conditioners.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<div>We're also tracking an RE-20 on the cab and speaker from a car subwoofer wired up to serve as a microphone.</div>
<div>There's a slight low-end hum in the RE-20 and speaker-mic but these are quite; they don't bother me much. I have samples of each input along with a direct box between the instrument and the amp:</div>

<div>(A good pair of headphones help)</div>
