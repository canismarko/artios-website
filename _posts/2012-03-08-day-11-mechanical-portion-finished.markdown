Well the mechanical portion of the RepRap is now finished. I added the extruder, secured all the motors and added the top print plate (blue). The blue part is painter's tape. The print plate needs to be coated in something that the plastic will stick to as it comes out of the extruder. Apparently painter's tape is the perfect material.

After that was all done I added the endstops. The controller needs to know where zero is on each axis. To do this, a switch (endstop) is mounted to each axis near the edge of the print area (X and Y-axes) or when the nozzle is a fraction of a millimeter above the print plate (Z-axis). Next I'll be working on wiring everything together and adding the electronics. I also need to install some software, which might take some work.
