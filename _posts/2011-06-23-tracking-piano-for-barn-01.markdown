So the last post mentioned that we might be able to save some time by tracking Pat's fancy Norg keyboard instead of miking a real piano. While we love the sound of the recital hall in the Dalton center the keyboard really sounded great. We played around with sounds and found a set we like. Actually, we can download an entire library of piano sounds from the internet and transfer them via USB.

We got most of his part tracked for <em>Barn 01</em> while I had a chance to learn something about MIDI. Those of you who went through the recording program at WSS know what an event that is. Anyway, forward progress is always nice and an hour or two more and we can check this part off the list.
