      So the last post mentioned that we might be able to save some
      time by tracking Pat's fancy Norg keyboard instead of miking a
      real piano. While we love the sound of the recital hall in the
      Dalton center the keyboard really sounded great. We played
      around with sounds and found a set we like. Actually, we can
      download an entire library of piano sounds from the internet and
      transfer them via USB.

      We got most of his part tracked for <em>Barn 01</em> while I had
      a chance to learn something about MIDI. Those of you who went
      through the recording program at WSS know what an event that
      is. Anyway, forward progress is always nice and an hour or two
      more and we can check this part off the list.
