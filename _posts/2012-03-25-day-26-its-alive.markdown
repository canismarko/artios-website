After a whole lot of headache, I now finally have the electronics talking to my computer. Out of the box, and <a title="Arduino home page" href="1Tgcj0Kj3u8">Arduino board</a> doesn't know how to do anything; it's a blank slate. In order for it to know what to do, it needs some special code know as <a title="Wikipedia page for 'firmware'" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware">firmware</a>. The are many options for the RepRap each with their own pros and cons. I decided to go with <a title="RepRap wiki page for Sprinter" href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Sprinter">Sprinter</a> because it supports the SD card reader and seems fairly well documented (we'll see if that's actually true).

Having chosen a firmware I then need to get it onto the Arduino board. This is where I ran into problems. Arduino makes a piece of software that will talk to the board. I had all kinds of problems getting this running on Fedora. Remember the talk of an AVR toolchain from <a title="Day 13 â€“ Software Installation" href="http://artiosband.com/blog/2012/03/12/day-13-software-installation/" target="_blank">day 13</a>? Well I got the latest version installed but it no longer had support for a large number of variables that the arduino software needed. The stable version, which I assume still supports the deprecated variables, did not install on Gentoo. I booted into an installation of <a title="Fedora homepage" href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Core 16</a> which I then used to install all the needed software. I tweaked the configuration files for Sprinter, flashed it to Arduino and all was good.

After that I switched back to Gentoo and fired up Repsnapper. Repsnapper controls the RepRap through the Arduino board. I have controls to move all the axes, move the extruder forward or back, and turn on the hot-end. Unfortunately the hot-end didn't actually get hot. A red light came on and there was 12V across the resistor, but no heat. I guess that's the next challenge.
