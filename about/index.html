  <h1>About the Band</h1>

  <p>
    Artios is a motivated pop/rock band formed in western Michigan with
    some members now residing in Chicago. They are a five piece band with
    a powerful sound, focusing on quality songwriting and energetic live
    performances. To get an idea of their sound, imagine The Beatles go on
    a ski trip to the Alps. After a failed attempt at the terrain park,
    they crash into one another creating a huge Beatle snowball that rolls
    over Billy Joel in the moguls and then smashes into the lodge where
    Stevie Ray Vaughn is playing. Somewhere in the rubble you will find
    the sweet sound of Artios.
  </p>
  <p>
    From bars and clubs to live shows on the radio, Artios has
    performed in numerous venues throughout southwest Michigan and
    Chicago to promote the release of their EP, entitled
    Siren. Recently, they performed as part of the <em>Live, Loud N'
      Local</em> festival. In 2011 their music helped cheer on
    participants in the first ever Kalamazoo Marathon, with over 1,500
    in attendance. Artios is also currently in the process of
    recording their first full length album, utilizing the knowledge
    of several Artios members with experience as professional sound
    engineers. They recently released <em>Home</em> and <em>The
      Vision </em>off their future album on WIDR 89.1FM.

  <p>
    Founding members of Artios, Erik Sebastian (guitar, vocals); Ryan
    Cousins (drums, vocals); and Patrick Sebastian (keyboard, vocals),
    have been playing together for over a decade with roots as a blues
    oriented group and later adding Mike Grammes on guitar, sax and
    vocals. With the final addition of Mark Wolf (bass, vocals) the
    band has been hard at work writing original music and building up
    a following in the Midwest. Artios plans to release their first
    full length album and begin promoting it with a regional tour
    within a year.

	to a variety of other instruments. His biggest influences have
	been Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughn, the Beatles and many more
	while he searched for his own musical style. When he’s not

	Mike has been involved with music most of his life. He has
	received a Bachelor of Arts in Music with a creative writing
	minor from Western Michigan University. Mike was born and
	raised in various places in Michigan until he finally settled
	in Kalamazoo and joined Artios. His musical power is contained
	in his “chops” and he will never let a Delilah cut them
	off. His musical influences are anything that he deems “good
	music” which mostly means jazz, blues, and anything that
	rocks. For Mike music is the soul’s communication with the
	world.

	Mark hails from the sunny shores of England. He’s been playing
	since he was eleven and spent most of his time in the jazz
	idiom. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in music and
	chemistry in 2008 and has been expanding his music horizons
	since then. In his spare time he likes to snowboard, play
	soccer and take long walks on the beach. When he says long, he
	means long. None of those one or two hour walks. He plans to
	continue playing bass long into the years of senility.

<!-- Artios’s sound has matured from strong blues roots into a more modern -->
<!-- rock/pop style that still maintains the spontaneity and soul of blues -->
<!-- with the addition of hard rocking riffs and listener friendly melodies -->
<!-- and harmonies. Each member of Artios has strong musical backgrounds -->
<!-- that range from jazz to rock, from blues to country and even -->
<!-- classical, with everything in between. Through the melding of these -->
<!-- different styles and the level of each person’s musicianship Artios -->
<!-- has developed a style that is distinctly its own. -->
